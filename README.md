# Automated Feeder

An Automated Feeder designed for guinea pigs (and adaptable for other animals). It operates using an ESP8266 microcontroller. As part of the project, a rotating screw mechanism was 3D printed to dispense the feed.

## Scheme
A Project Scheme was designed in Eagle

## Parts

- Processor: ESP8266 WiFi
- LCD 4x20 green LCD-01136
- Clock RTC: MSX RTC DS1307
- Stepper motor: 28BYJ-48
- Power: Impulse Power Supply 3-12V/1.2A (for this project 5V)
- Mechanism: Rotating Screw (Printer 3D)

## How it works now

It is currently functioning without the need for WiFi. The settings have been configured directly (programmatically), but rest assured, the project will receive updates soon.
